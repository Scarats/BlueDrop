# BlueDrop

Prompt:

I want to learn Bluetooth LE on Linux. To do so I would like to send a message from one computer to another. I want to do it in C. I don't know how to use any BLE lib. 
I want you to make a tutorial step by step with clear explanations, a pedagological approach and details.
When it comes to coding, I want you to explain each step, build the code line by line / by block, to make sure everything is understandable. Also explain why we are using some functions or methods or techniques ...
Go slowly, I'm here to learn the very basics of BLE communication, do not assume i have any prior technical knowledge. At first i want to have the simpliest code possible.
The final goal is to create a custom mesh network over BLE.
I don't want to use GATT, I will implement a custom protocol.
But don't rush it, make it step by step in deep details.
